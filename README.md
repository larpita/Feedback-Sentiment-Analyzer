# Feedback-Sentiment-Analyzer

## Overview
A machine learning project that classifies user feedback as Positive or Negative using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF
- Logistic Regression
- Gradio (UI)

## Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Text vectorization using TF-IDF
3. Model training with Logistic Regression
4. Model evaluation
5. Real-time prediction using a simple UI

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies
2. Run the notebook 
3. Enter text to get sentiment prediction

## Results
Achieved ~81.6% accuracy on unseen test data.

## Future Improvements
- Handle mixed sentiment
- Extend to multi-class sentiment
- Deploy as a web app

## Limitations
The model uses a bag-of-words approach and may struggle with mixed sentiment sentences.
